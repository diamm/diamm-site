                    resource, papers which have been read at conferences or published which have
                    been made possible by, or use the DIAMM website or our images, and other related
                    information about DIAMM's impact in the scholarly community and more
                    broadly.</p>
                <p>We are particularly interested in papers which you may have published or
                    presented which draw on DIAMM resources.</p>
