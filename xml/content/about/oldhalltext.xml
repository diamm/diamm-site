				<head>The 'Old Hall' Manuscript (GB-London, British Library Add. Ms. 57950)</head>
				<p>Only four of the 'great' English choirbooks that must originally have numbered in
					their dozens (if not hundreds) survive today in a relatively intact state: Eton,
					Lambeth, Gonville and Caius and Old Hall. Old Hall got its name from a former
					location, St Edmund's College Library, Old Hall Green, nr Ware in Hertforshire.
					Now preserved in the British Library, the fragility and value of the manuscript
					means that it is no longer possible for scholars to handle it, so the images on
					DIAMM are currently the best and only way for members of the public to see the
					MS without buying the images themselves. It was originally copied c. 1410-20,
					though much of the music was composed before that. It may at one time have been
					at Winchester Cathedral, and is a very important source for the music of one of
					the most famous composers of the medieval period, John Dunstaple, and also
					contains works ascribed to King Henry. The music is mostly sacred, and is copied
					in black and red ink. Each piece opens with a beautifully decorated initial. The
					original book is very large as it was intended to be read from by all the
					singers at once. The book will be published in facsimile by DIAMM
					Publications.</p>
