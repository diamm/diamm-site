                <head>Donate to DIAMM</head>
                <p>DIAMM is under constant pressure to find funding to maintain our online presence. We are dedicated to keeping
                    this resource free to all users but we have no public or private funding to allow us to do this.
                    If you value you this resource and would like to help keep it free, or if you would like to help us find money to digitize important manuscripts and put them online here, we would
                    like to invite you to donate any amount of money to DIAMM to help us achieve
                    this goal.</p>
                <p>Funds will be used to continue building the collection of images; maintain the
                    web resource so that it contines to function; provide management time to continue to add new metadata to
                    the database; and to make images available to scholars and students.</p>
                <p>DIAMM has an <ref type="external"
                        target="http://tinyurl.com/DIAMMpubs">online shop</ref>. At the bottom of
                    the page is an option for you to donate to the project using your credit card.
                    Please consider supporting the work we do in this way.</p>
