				<head>The Dow Partbooks (GB-Oxford, Christ Church Library, MSS 984-988)</head>
				<p>This is a complete set of five partbooks (each voice part was written in its own
					book) containing motets, anthems, consort music and consort songs, copied c.
					1581-88 principally by Robert Dow (1553-88), a fellow of All Souls College,
					Oxford, with later additions by John Baldwin and another unidentified copyist.
					This set is one of the most important surviving music manuscripts from
					Elizabethan England, and a major source of sacred and secular works by William
					Byrd. It is also famous for Dow's exquisite penmanship, executed in black ink
					over staves previously printed in red. Although many sets of partbooks survive
					from this period, few are so easy to read, and many of the sets are incomplete,
					lacking one or more of the books. Dow is not only complete, but was very
					accurately copied, so is a very reliable source for the music that it preserves.
					The whole set is published in facsimile by DIAMM Publications.</p>
