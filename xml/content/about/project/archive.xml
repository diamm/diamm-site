                <p> DIAMM will eventually list all known manuscripts of Medieval European Music,
                    together with metadata about each source. A large proportion of the catalogued
                    sources are already described in our database and these descriptions can be
                    accessed by following the links below, which include manuscripts not
                    photographed and archived by the project as well as those already archived. The
                    manuscripts are listed by the country and archive where they are to be found,
                    not by their provenance.</p>
                <p>Not all images archived by DIAMM are available via the website portal, but this
                    list is constantly under review. Sources followed by a tick in the following
                    lists may be viewed at high resolution online by registered users. Registration
                    is free of charge and open to anyone wishing to access these documents (please
                    follow links for <ref type="internal" cRef="p9_7_2">Registering</ref>). You may
                    also search the content by using the 'Search' link. Library contacts and a
                    detailed manuscript list for each archive may be viewed by clicking on a library
                    name.</p>
