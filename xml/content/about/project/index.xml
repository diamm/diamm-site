                <p>These pages primarily provide information about the people and institutions
                    involved with DIAMM. The project has been running since 1998 and has involved
                    researchers, collection-holders, funding bodies and other projects
                    worldwide.</p>
                <p>This section also describes the scope of the project and the content that can be
                    searched and accessed here. The project was conceived primarily (and in fact
                    only) as an image archive, for storing images of manuscripts against their loss
                    from natural degradation. At the time researchers were not using the internet as
                    a serious research resource. With the very rapid growth and expansion of the
                    internet the â€˜archive' created an output which resulted in the web resource
                    presented in these pages.</p>
