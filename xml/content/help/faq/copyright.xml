                    <head>Why can't I download the images?</head>
                    <p>DIAMM delivers images via a complex web-delivery system. The images are not
                        owned by DIAMM, but are available online through us thanks to rights
                        agreements with the owning institutions, and this rights agreement prohibits
                        the free download of images. DIAMM does not have permission to sell or give
                        away any of these images, since we are not the copyright holder. More
                        details about this can be found on the <ref type="internal" cRef="p2_3"
                            >Rights Protection page.</ref> If you wish to obtain personal copies of
                        images that you have seen on the DIAMM website you need to contact the
                        library that owns them. Clicking on the library name in any view will take
                        you to the library contact details.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <head>I want to show pictures from the website in a lecture/presentation. Will I
                        be infringing copyright or breaching my access agreement?</head>
                    <p>The Website Access Agreement is clear that the images may only be used for
                        research or non-commercial reasons. Since teaching falls under this category
                        you may show any page from the DIAMM website either as a screenshot or live
                        during a lecture.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <head>I want to publish an article using images from the DIAMM website. How can
                        I get permission?</head>
                    <p>If you wish to obtain print-quality copies of images that you have seen on
                        the DIAMM website you need to contact the library that owns them to obtain
                        permission. For publications you (or your publisher) may have to pay a
                        reproduction rights fee, although this is usually waived for academic (i.e.
                        non-profit) publications. Clicking on the library name in any view will take
                        you to the library contact details. Make sure that you give the accurate
                        information about which image(s) you require as it is extremely frustrating
                        for libraries if they are simply given the name of a piece. You must supply
                        the correct, complete shelf-mark for the manuscript, and the exact folio
                        number(s) of the images you require: this is found in the text displayed
                        beneath the images.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <head>I want to get copies of the original images that I have seen on the
                        website. How can I get them?</head>
                    <p>If you wish to obtain copies of images that you have seen on the DIAMM
                        website you need to contact the library that owns them to obtain permission.
                        You will need to specify the size/quality of the image you want. Remember
                        that web-sized images are unsuitable for printing. If you ask for the
                        full-sized images you will need image-processing software such as Photoshop
                        or PaintShop Pro to open them. Clicking on the library name in any view will
                        take you to the library contact details. Make sure that you give the
                        accurate information about which image(s) you require as it is extremely
                        frustrating for libraries if they are simply given the name of a piece. You
                        must supply the correct, complete shelf-mark for the manuscript, and the
                        exact folio number(s) of the images you require: this is found in the text
                        displayed beneath the images.</p>

                    <head>I am a collection holder and would like to have my digital images included
                        in the DIAMM collection. Will I have to pay to have them included?</head>
                    <p>There is no currently charge for adding your images of music manuscripts to
                        the DIAMM collection. Our delivery mechanism was built to handle as many
                        images as we can put into it, and the success of the site is largely
                        dependent on its content. We are therefore more than happy to include
                        digital images from other collections, provided there is no copyright
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>If your collection is of non-musical items we may also be able to deliver the
                        images. For a small number of images there would be no charge, but for
                        collections of significant size we may need to acquire more server space,
                        and that additional cost would have to be met by the depositor. Please
                        contact us if you would like more information about this service.</p>
