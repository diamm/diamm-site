                    <p>DIAMM was conceived as a resource for academic researchers working on
                        Medieval music. Because it was designed for users who are already familiar
                        with the information it contains, it may not be immediately obvious when you
                        enter the site how to find out what is here and in what ways you can use
                        it.</p>
                    <p>We hope in the future to add a section that helps non-expert users to get
                        more out of the website. We would be glad to hear of any suggestions for
                        content in that section. Please use the <ref type="internal" cRef="p1_9"
                            >contact page</ref> to send in your suggestions.</p>

                        sections.</p>
