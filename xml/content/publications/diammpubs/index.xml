                <p>
                    <hi rend="bold">A full-colour facsimile edition of Eton College Library, MS
                        178</hi>
                </p>
                <p><figure><graphic url="Eton2" rend="left"/></figure>One of the most iconic of music manuscripts, the
                    Eton Choirbook is of unique importance, both in its own right as a cultural
                    artefact and as a source of English choral polyphony composed during the late
                    fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Had it perished, along with so many
                    other (less fortunate) pre-Reformation music manuscripts, our knowledge of a
                    critical moment in the history of English music would have been immensely
                    diminished.</p>
                <p>Ever since it was first copied for use in the college chapel in the early 1500s,
                    the choirbook has been continuously in the possession of Eton College. Several
                    composers whose works were included in it had close associations with the
                    college, not least Robert Wylkynson, who served as the college's informator
                    choristarum from 1500. Other composers represented include Banaster, Browne,
                    Cornyshe, Davy, Fawkyner, Fayrfax, Hygons, Lambe and Turges. Most of its
                    original contents (67 out of a total of 93 pieces) were votive antiphons, or
                    devotional motets of prayer and praise, sung each evening to the Virgin Mary,
                    the college's dedicatee. The Salve ceremony, familiar to worshippers throughout
                    Catholic Europe, lay at the heart of Eton College's raison d'être as a
                    chantry college: the Eton Choirbook is an eloquent witness to this flowering of
                    devotional culture on the eve of the Reformation.</p>
                <p><figure><graphic url="Eton3" rend="right"/></figure>The manuscript is also a work of consummate
                    artistry, copied by an experienced scribe on large vellum leaves, and
                    illuminated by a professional limner. Even in its in-complete state (nearly half
                    of its original 224 leaves have been lost), the Eton Choirbook is the undoubted
                    queen of early Tudor music manuscripts.</p>
                <p>The Choirbook is presented in full colour facsimile on heavy matt art paper,
                    hard bound, with an introduction by Magnus Williamson (Newcastle University) and
                    published by the Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music (University of
                    Oxford)</p>

                    1580, rank among the most beautiful of all Tudor music manuscripts, and are also
                    an important and authoritative source for the works they contain. Conceived with
                    both singers and instrumentalists in mind, they contain a varied repertory
                    suitable for voices and viols, including Latin-texted motets, English-texted
                    anthems and consort songs, and a selection of In nomines and textless chansons,
                    scored mainly for five-voice texture. Featured composers include William Byrd,
                    Thomas Tallis, Robert White, Robert Parsons, Philip van Wilder and Alfonso
                    Ferrabosco Sr. Dow was a trained calligrapher, and his exquisite penmanship,
                    executed in black ink on printed red staves, is unusually accurate and easy to
                    read.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LIM Editrice, Lucca, has published these volumes in collaboration with DIAMM.
                    Copies are only available through LIM or their distributors. Their website is

                <p><figure><graphic url="Q15-1" rend="left"/></figure>This manuscript is the largest international
                    anthology of polyphonic music of the early 15th century. It was compiled in the
                    Veneto, in Padua in the early 1420s (stage I) and Vicenza in the early 1430s
                    (stages II-III), all copied by a single scribe between 1420 and 1435. The three
                    illuminations are an unusual luxury for a musical manuscript at this period. It
                    was acquired by Padre Martini in 1757 and is one of the great treasures of his
                    library in Bologna.</p>
                <p>About half of its 323 compositions are unique; some others are shared with and
                    complemented by the slightly younger Veneto manuscripts Bologna, Biblioteca
                    Universitaria 2216 and Oxford, Canon. misc. 213. It is the most important source
                    for the works of Zacara and Ciconia and for the early works of Guillaume Du Fay
                    (with 78 works, nearly a quarter of the manuscript, many of them unica). About
                    50 composers are represented, including native Italians, and composers from the
                    north who were sought after and made their careers in Italy.</p>
                <p>It is primarily a collection of mass movements (mostly Glorias and Credos, and a
                    few cycles) and motets. Du Fay's Missa Sancti Jacobi was assembled as a cycle
                    only here, and can now be linked with the circle in which Q15 was compiled. </p>
                <p>Margaret Bent tells the complete story of this manuscript in her extensive
                    introductory study, which also includes comprehensive indexes and catalogues.
                    She spells out some of the conclusions to be drawn from the partial destruction
                    of the manuscript by its own creator, a unique and extraordinary testimony to
                    changing taste and contemporary reception.</p>
                <p>Deluxe limited edition consisting of introductory study (400 pp) and facsimile

                <p><hi rend="bold">An introduction to digital restoration techniques using high
                    resolution digital images.</hi></p>
                <p><figure><graphic url="workbook" rend="left"/></figure>The DIAMM Digital Restoration Workbook was
                    written in response to a demand for information about digital restoration
                    techniques demonstrated by Dr Craig-McFeely at various conferences and other
                    venues. With the financial and administrative support of the AHRC ICT Methods
                    Network a workshop was organised in June 2006 for which this textbook was
                    printed. The printed copies are sold out, but as it was prepared as press-ready
                    pdf this has now been made available for download. The copy supplied is at print
                    resolution so that the colour images can be clearly read both on screen and when
                    printed.</p>
                <p>The book utilises samples and images drawn from the DIAMM collection, and the
                    images were used by the workshop participants. Due to rights
                    restrictions the images are only available for demonstration purposes and are
                    therefore not available for download. However, access
                    to the images shown in the workbook, and the samples prepared for the workshop
                    is not essential to an understanding of the techniques described, which can
                    easily be applied to any image of suitable type and resolution. The workbook has
                    proved a useful starting point for dealing with images of damaged documents for
                    researchers in many fields, both those with prior experience of digital
                    restoration and those who have never attempted to adjust an image.</p>
                <p>The techniques described make use of Adobe Photoshop, and do not require more
                    than a fairly basic knowledge of the software in order to understand the
                    descriptions. Those unfamiliar with Photoshop may need a little while to
                    familiarise themselves with the software interface before embarking on
                    restoration work using the workbook, but should find the information in the
                    workbook helpful in understanding and accessing the various tools available. All
                    the images in the book are copyright and may not be reproduced except for
                    personal research purposes. The workbook may be downloaded on the understanding
