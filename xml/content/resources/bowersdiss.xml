                    presented for examination in 1975 and, unsurprisingly, significant elements of
                    its content have been superseded by better work undertaken subsequently by
                    others. Nevertheless, most of its substance remains unpublished, and perhaps
                    there are parts of it which still have value, arising not least from its
                    endeavour to offer cover of its subject-matter that eschewed selectivity in
                    favour of an approach that was comprehensive and all-embracing.</p>

                <!-- Abstract -->
                <p>[Taken from 'Introductory:'] This thesis deals with the history of English
                    liturgical choirs between the years 1340 and 1500. It seeks to enlighten the
                    history of pre-Reformation English church music by relating to it the history of
                    the personnel to whom its performance was entrusted. In the period of 160 years
                    which is covered, the forces available to perform liturgical and religious music
                    in England experienced an eventful history. In the first place, the number of
                    choral establishments which already existed in 1340 was greately expanded not
                    only by a steady stream of wholly new collegiate and other foundations, but also
                    by the adoption of musical responsibilities by existing religious institutions
                    which previously had shown no particular enthusiasm for music. Further, the
                    constitution and composition of liturgical choirs, and the functions and duties
                    expected of their various members, underwent far-reaching modifications over the
                    time. As one period succeeded another, the statutes of new establishments
                    reflected changing conceptions of what constituted the idea (or best practical)
                    force for performing the church music of its time; to which older-established
                    instutinos had either to adapt the composition of their own personnel, or get
                    left behind. This research seeks to expose and clarify the nature of these
                    successive modifications, and to offer explanations for why they were found
                    necessary.</p>
