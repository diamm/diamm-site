            <p>DIAMM continually tries to expand its offerings the users of this site. To this end,
                we have begun to provide resources other than merely digital images. At the moment,
                these consist of newly completed scholarly editions of music related to the research
                interests of DIAMM and fully browsable and searchable PhD dissertations also in this area
                of scholarship.</p>
